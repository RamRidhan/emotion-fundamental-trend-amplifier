        "**(1) Macroeconomic Indicators**\n",
        "- Macroeconomic indicators shape the external context in which firms operate. Investors monitor them to reassess both market-wide risk premia and sectoral growth outlooks.\n",
        "- Inflation and monetary policy signals, including CPI, Treasury yields and the Fed Funds Rate, anchor discount rate expectations. These metrics alter how investors value distant cash flows, influencing preferences between growth and value stocks (Fabozzi, 2015; Fama, 1990).\n",
        "- Employment and spending data, such as the unemployment rate and retail sales, shape forecasts of consumer demand. Positive surprises in labour or consumption figures can reprice equities upward, especially in consumer discretionary and financial sectors.\n",
        "- The inclusion of weekly-normalised deltas of these macro variables allows the model to internalise the direction and velocity of economic change—an element often missed in static factor models.\n",
        "\n",
        "**(2) Fundamental Financial Ratios**\n",
        "- Fundamental indicators provide a window into a firm’s operational and financial structure. These ratios remain critical for long-horizon investors, but also hold short-term significance when markets reprice firms around earnings announcements or guidance shifts.\n",
        "- Profitability metrics like ROE and net profit margin reflect earnings quality and managerial efficiency. When profitability improves concurrently with macro tailwinds, the signal becomes more powerful (Penman, 2013; Piotroski, 2000).\n",
        "- Leverage indicators, such as debt-to-equity, affect a firm’s sensitivity to credit conditions. In tightening cycles, highly leveraged firms underperform due to higher interest burdens and refinancing risks (Altman, 1968).\n",
        "- By converting quarterly ratios into weekly deltas, the model captures momentum in fundamentals—an aspect that mirrors analyst upgrade cycles and investor rebalancing behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "**(3) Emotion and Sentiment Layer**\n",
        "- Investor emotions, extracted from X posts and RSS news feeds, represent short-term belief formation under uncertainty. These signals capture not what firms are worth, but what investors think they are worth—a key distinction in behavioural finance (Barberis et al., 1998).\n",
        "- Polarity and intensity scores from BERT embeddings allow the model to weight sentiment by confidence, not just frequency. Strongly polarised views (e.g. post-earnings) can act as catalysts for sharp price moves—especially when fundamentals are ambiguous.\n",
        "- Unlike traditional sentiment measures that average out noise, this layer preserves emotional extremes, which are often more predictive of short-term reversals or continuations (Tetlock, 2007).\n",
        "\n",
        "**(4) Cross-Market Echoes:**\n",
        "- Cross-asset signals—notably Bitcoin and commodity price trends—serve as indirect sentiment barometers and liquidity proxies. For instance, rising Bitcoin prices may indicate risk-on positioning across speculative assets (Zhang & Yan, 2020).\n",
        "- Oil prices, while rooted in supply-demand fundamentals, influence equity sectors like energy and industrials. Their movement often anticipates inflation expectations and global growth sentiment.\n",
        "- By integrating these echoes via an attention mechanism, the model learns which non-equity assets matter when, thus adapting to structural shifts (e.g., rising crypto-equity correlations during periods of speculative fervour)."
